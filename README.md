Week 5 Hands-On Activity (5pts Extra credit)
Activity Overview:
Work in groups to implement and compare advanced supervised learning algorithms on a healthcare-related dataset focusing on disease prediction. Apply hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
Instructions:
Dataset Preparation:
Load a healthcare-related dataset (e.g., predicting the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease based on health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.).
Split the data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
Model Implementation:
Implement three models:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
Random Forest Classifier
Train each model using the training dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for each of the models (e.g., SVM's kernel, Random Forest's n_estimators, etc.).
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate each model using the following metrics:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-score
AUC-ROC
Compare the performance of the models on the test data.
Model Comparison & Reflection:
Create a summary table comparing the models' performance based on the metrics.
Reflect on which model performed best and why. Discuss how hyperparameter tuning affected your results.
Deliverables:
Push your Jupyter notebook or Quarto file to a GitHub repository. Submit your repository, along with a summary of findings. Monday class.
Present the model comparison and key insights to the class in a 5-minute presentation. Tuesday class.
